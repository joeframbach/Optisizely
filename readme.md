# Optisizely

Did you know? Optimizely bundles together **all** of your experiment and variation code into one big bundle, and loads it on **every** page on your site which uses Optimizely.

This is a cool visualization to show how much your Optimizely test adds to page load time.

## Running Optisizely

This is entirely static, no api or dynamic content. Just run whichever static server you want. Python's SimpleHttpServer, npm install http-server, etc.
